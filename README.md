## Medical-Insurance-Price-Prediction

Accurate and fair pricing for medical insurance policies is not only crucial for insurance companies but also essential for ensuring equitable access to healthcare services for individuals. 

#### PROBLEM STATEMENT
There is a medical insurance company and this company wants to create an automatic system that can predict what is Medical insurance cost for an individual.
You being a data scientist the company has approached you and so you have to prepare a machine learning system that can learn from the data and it can predict what will be the cost for insurance premium.

In the development of our machine learning model for medical insurance premium prediction, I have followed a comprehensive workflow encompassing data collection, preprocessing, data visualization, model construction, training, and the implementation of a predictive system. Each step played a critical role in ensuring the robustness and accuracy of our model. 
I have collected the data from secondary sources, that is, Kaggle. This is being Visualized on the basis of various aspects and the preprocessing is done using various operations and functions. Then the model was built of Linear Regression. And at last there is a predictive system which detects the insurance cost for an individual. 

#### WORKFLOW
1) Data collection
2) Data analysis & visualization
3) Data preprocessing
4) Data splitting
5) Model building
6) Model training
7) Prediction
